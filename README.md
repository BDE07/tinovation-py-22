# tinovation-py-22

Code resources for Tinovation Python Sub-team (2022-2023)


As an officer, I was responsible for creating the majority of these code samples, and they will continue to be updated throughout the year with the lessons we'll do for those according weeks. 

If you plan on using this code for your own public distribution, make sure to credit Daniel and I as the creators of the code sample. Thank you again, and enjoy coding~
